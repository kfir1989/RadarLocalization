Tuesday:
1. use tracks up to last updated state (not more than that)
2. enlarge noise on angle (PF) [might be not necessary)
4. try to enlarge uncertainty when avg(log cost) is too high
5. extract corners from digital map -> add to prior list of input to static tracker


Methods:
1. polynom tracking: 
- Explain motiviation behind using KF framework for polynoms
- write some equations and add: static simulation results (different measurement noises, different noise on prior)
- Add dynamic simulation results with noise on rotation translation at each step (no noise on prior)
- Add contribution: several priors, similarity check and show simulation the supports that
simulation:
- generate two polynoms with the same coefficients, but with a gap between them.
- Add several biases in a0,a1,a2 coeffients of the polynom
- examine the algoithm as opposed to the original one (error on the coefficients + innerproduct of substraction)



2. EKF for dynamic tracks + clustering: explain briefly and give some equations

3. Map-matching: particle filter with different noise on translation-rotation, explain cost function and give psuedo algorithm.

Results:

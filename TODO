Tuesday:

1. similar to static - plot a cost function graph for dynamic tracks.
2. enlarge noise on angle (PF)
3. run and see results
4. try to enlarge uncertainty when avg(log cost) is too high

Methods:
1. polynom tracking: 
- Explain motiviation behind using KF framework for polynoms
- write some equations and add: static simulation results (different measurement noises, different noise on prior)
- Add dynamic simulation results with noise on rotation translation at each step (no noise on prior)
- Add contribution: several priors, similarity check and show simulation the supports that

2. EKF for dynamic tracks + clustering: explain briefly and give some equations

3. Map-matching: particle filter with different noise on translation-rotation, explain cost function and give psuedo algorithm.

Results:
